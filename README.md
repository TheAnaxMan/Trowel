# Trowel

Its a very small QoL mod to make building less tedious. This mod is a simple port of the Quark mods Trowel item. Its been written from scratch by me. I just borrowed the original idea from Quark.

## Dependencies

This mod Depends on [Kotlin](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-language-kotlin)
*(I'm sorry for dependency)*

## How it works

If you don't know what the Trowel does. When right clicked it picks a random block from your hotbar and places is down.
